 * React I & II code.
 * Feel free to get a head start on building the skeleton of this component.
 * Leave the styling off for later, instead try focusing on functionality first!

 * Features:
 *  - Navigation component
 *  - Built in filter or a separate component, would love to hear thoughts
 *  - User name/profile picture
 *  - Populates a list of all the summary items, once clicked links to a separate
