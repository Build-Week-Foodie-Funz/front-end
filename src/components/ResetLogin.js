/*
 * React I code.
 * Feel free to get a head start on building the skeleton of this component.
 * Leave the styling off for later, instead try focusing on functionality first!
 *
 * If user forgets their password, this is a form to reset it. Kate will handle
 * the updating the state and database through server, so your task is to have some
 * local state set up from where I can grab that information.
