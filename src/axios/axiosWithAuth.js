/*
 * React II code.
 * Feel free to get yourself familiar with it but
 * please do not modify it without letting Kate know first âœ¨
 *
 * Code's purpose: When initial authorization token is retrived, this component
 * essentially adds a header with that token to every server request. Kinda like when
 * you reserve space in a restaurant and someone asks for your name to ensure you're
 * the right person with more access rights/permissions :)
